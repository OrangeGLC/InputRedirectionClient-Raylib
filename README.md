# InputRedirectionClient-Raylib
Fork from [InputRedirectionClient-Qt](https://github.com/TuxSH/InputRedirectionClient-Qt). Use Raylib instead of Qt.

# Notes
- Left arrow and right arrow keys are used to switch between gamepads.
- (Xbox) Left trigger and (Xbox) right trigger do the same thing as the left and right (Xbox) bumpers.
- There is a dead zone of 0.05f (5%) on joystick axes.
- Everything, but the touch screen redirection (obviously), will work even if the window is not focussed. :3
