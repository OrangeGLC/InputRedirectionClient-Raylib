# InputRedirectionClient-Raylib
Man, I fucking hate Qt. Don't ask me why. I just do. This works on anything that can detect gamepad input, and can run Raylib.

# Notes
- Left arrow and right arrow keys are used to switch between gamepads.
- (Xbox) Left trigger and (Xbox) right trigger do the same thing as the left and right (Xbox) bumpers.
- There is a dead zone of 0.05f (5%) on joystick axes.
